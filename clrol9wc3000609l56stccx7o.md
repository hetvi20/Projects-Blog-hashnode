Embracing DevOps Interview Mock Practices for DEVOPS. This article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of essential concepts related to DevOps, Docker, Jenkins, SonarQube, Kubernetes, and Terraform. 🚀 Practice it and level up your DevOps knowledge!

1. **IAAS and PAAS:** Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS) offers virtualized computing resources, while Platform as a Service (PAAS) provides a platform for developing, running, and managing applications without dealing with underlying infrastructure complexities. 💻
    
2. **AZ and Regions:** Availability Zones (AZ) are unique physical locations within a region, housing data centers. Regions are geographical areas containing one or more AZs, each with its own set of services. 🌍
    
3. **Docker Run and CMD Commands:**
    
    * `docker run`: Used to run a container from an image.
        
    * `CMD`: Instruction in a Dockerfile to provide default commands for the container. 🐳
        
4. **Docker Network Types:**
    
    * Bridge network
        
    * Host network
        
    * Overlay network
        
    * Macvlan network 🌐
        
5. **Default Network in Docker:** The default network in Docker is the bridge network. 🌉
    
6. **Bridge Network in Docker:** A bridge network is the default network in Docker, facilitating communication between containers on the same network. It allows outbound connectivity and isolates containers on different networks by default. 🌐
    
7. **Docker Container Creation Process:**
    
    1. Write a Dockerfile.
        
    2. Build an image using docker build.
        
    3. Run a container using docker run. 🏗️
        
8. **Static vs. Declarative Pipeline in Jenkins:**
    
    * Static Pipeline: Defined with imperative steps in a Jenkinsfile.
        
    * Declarative Pipeline: Uses a simplified, structured syntax for the Jenkinsfile. 🚀
        
9. **Best Practices for Jenkins Integration:**
    
    * Use version control for Jenkinsfiles.
        
    * Securely manage credentials and secrets.
        
    * Regularly update plugins.
        
    * Implement security best practices. 🔒
        
10. **Docker Command for Expose:** `docker run -p 80:80 my-container` 🛳️
    
11. **Controller Manager in Kubernetes:** The Controller Manager in Kubernetes manages controller processes that regulate the state of the cluster, such as node controller and replication controller. 🤖
    
12. **Use of API-Server in Kubernetes:** The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API, serving as the front end for the control plane. 🚀
    
13. **Argument vs. Attribute in Terraform:**
    
    * Argument: Parameters passed to a resource or module.
        
    * Attribute: Values returned by a resource or module. Example: `resource "example" { name = "example-instance" }` 🛠️
        
14. **Docker 'FROM' Keyword:** The FROM keyword in Docker specifies the base image for a Dockerfile. 🏗️
    
15. **Base Image in Docker:** A base image is the foundation of a Docker image upon which other images can be built. 🚀
    
16. **COPY vs. ADD Command in Docker:**
    
    * COPY: Copies files from the local host to the container.
        
    * ADD: Similar to COPY but with additional features like extracting tarballs. 📦
        
17. **Use of -p in Docker Command:** The -p flag in Docker commands publishes a container's port to the host. 🚪
    
18. **Expose -p vs. Docker Run -p:**
    
    * EXPOSE: Informs Docker that the container listens on specified network ports.
        
    * `docker run -p`: Publishes a container's port to the host. 🌐
        
19. **Data Storage in Docker Image:** Data in a Docker image is typically stored in volumes or bind mounts outside the container to persist beyond its lifecycle. 💾
    
20. **Four Important Pillars for DevOps:**
    
    * Security
        
    * Speed
        
    * Stability
        
    * Scalability 🏛️
        
21. **Connecting to a Remote Server:** Use the ssh command to connect to a remote server: `ssh username@remote_server_ip` 🌐
    
22. **Top 5 Used Shell Script Commands:**
    
    * echo
        
    * if
        
    * for
        
    * while
        
    * grep
        
23. **Edge Location and Wavelength in AWS:**
    
    * Edge Location: A data center endpoint for Amazon CloudFront.
        
    * Wavelength: An AWS infrastructure offering enabling applications to run at the edge of the 5G network. 🌐
        
24. **Running a POD on a Particular Node in Kubernetes:** To run a POD on a specific node in Kubernetes, use the `--node-name` option with `kubectl run`.
    
25. **Taints and Toleration in Kubernetes:**
    
    * Taints: Node affinity rules preventing pod scheduling unless tolerated.
        
    * Toleration: Pod specification allowing scheduling on nodes with specific taints. 🤖
        
26. **Mechanics for Deployment in Kubernetes:**
    
    * Rolling updates
        
    * Blue-green deployment
        
    * Canary deployment
        
27. **Terraform State File:** The Terraform state file maintains the state of the infrastructure, used for planning and applying changes. 📄
    
28. **State Lock in Terraform:** State lock is a mechanism in Terraform to prevent concurrent operations on the same state file, avoiding conflicts. 🔒
    
29. **Different Ways to Create Kubernetes:**
    
    * `kubectl apply`
        
    * `kubectl create`
        
    * `kubectl run`
        
30. **Kubernetes Scheduler:** The Kubernetes Scheduler assigns nodes to pods based on resource requirements, constraints, and policies. 🤖
    
31. **Checking CPU Utilization in Kubernetes:** Use `kubectl top nodes` to check CPU utilization on a specific cluster in Kubernetes. 📈
    
32. **Interpolation in Terraform:** Interpolation in Terraform is the process of embedding expressions within strings to produce a final string. 🔄
    
33. **Kubernetes Architecture:** Kubernetes architecture includes a master node (API server, controller manager, scheduler, etcd) and worker nodes (kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime), communicating via the Kubernetes API. 🏗️
    
34. **What is Ansible:** Ansible is an open-source automation tool designed to streamline various IT tasks, including configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and orchestration. 🤖
    
35. **What is Playbook** 📚\*\*:\*\* Playbooks are a central concept in Ansible, serving as a way to organize and execute automation tasks. They provide a higher-level abstraction for expressing configurations, deployments, and orchestration.
