**1) Tell me about yourself**

* This is a common opening question. You should talk about your educational background, any relevant projects or internships, and highlight your skills that make you suitable for the DevOps role.
    

**2) Port number for HTTP**

* The default port number for HTTP is 80.
    

**3) Port number for MySQL**

* The default port number for MySQL is 3306.
    

**4) Type of S3 bucket**

* S3 buckets in AWS can be of three types: Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, and One Zone-Infrequent Access.
    

**5) Why is Ansible more commonly used compared to Chef and Puppet?**

* Ansible is often preferred due to its simplicity, agentless architecture, and ease of use. It uses YAML for configuration management and doesn't require a master-node setup like Puppet or Chef.
    

**6) What is Docker?**

* Docker is a platform that enables developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers can run on any machine that has the Docker software installed, providing consistency across different environments.
    

**7) Docker run command**

* The basic Docker run command is:
    
    ```plaintext
    bashCopy codedocker run [options] [image]
    ```
    

**8) Why do we use GIT, and how do we create a sub-branch?**

* GIT is a version control system used for tracking changes in source code. To create a sub-branch, you can use the following command:
    
    ```plaintext
    bashCopy codegit checkout -b sub-branch-name
    ```
    

**9) Explain a troubleshooting situation and how you overcame it**

* Provide a real or hypothetical scenario where you faced an issue, explain the steps you took to identify the problem, and the solution you implemented.
    

**10) What is master and agent? Give me a scenario-based question for Jenkins.**

* In Jenkins, the master is the main server that manages and schedules jobs, while agents are nodes that execute these jobs. A scenario-based question could be: "How would you set up Jenkins to distribute a build job across multiple agents for faster execution?"
    

**11) Name any four Linux networking commands with system and working.**

* `ifconfig`: Displays information about network interfaces.
    
* `ping`: Tests network connectivity.
    
* `netstat`: Displays network-related information such as open ports.
    
* `traceroute`: Shows the route that packets take to reach a destination.
    

**12) Rename in Dockerfile - How do I do it?**

* To rename an image in a Dockerfile, you can use the `--name` option in the `docker build` command. For example:
    
    ```plaintext
    dockerfileCopy codeFROM old-image-name:tag
    # Other instructions
    ```
    
    And then build the Dockerfile using:
    
    ```plaintext
    bashCopy codedocker build --tag new-image-name:tag .
    ```
